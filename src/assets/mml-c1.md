Mathematics for machine learning
================================

We are following the book at 
https://mml-book.com 

This file is all about chapter one: introduction and motivation.

The chapter starts with a paragraph about what machine learning is all about. 

[quote]
Machine learning is about designing algorithms that automatically extract valuable information from data.

Let us break down this sentence. 
1. designing algorithms
2. automatically extract 
3. valuable information
4. data

The next sentence clarifies what we should focus on: the word automatically. 

This is the key focus of machine learning. 
We want to be able to generalize our work across data sets. 

What is valuable information though? 
Do we need to define this before we design our algorithm? 
Before we collect data? 
So many questions... 

Lets move on. 

The second paragraph talks about how data is at the core of machine learning. 
Machine learning is inherently data driven. 
The goal of machine learning is 
to design general purpose methodologies to extract valuable patterns from data 
ideally without much domain-specific expertise. 

But this brings more questions in my mind: 

How do we collect data? 
Don't we need "domain-specific expertise" just to be able to collect data? 
Can we just scoop up large swaths of data and just have this magical machine learning 
just tell us which data is relevant and which is not? 

Like I said, so many questions... 

Next comes the concept of a model. 
A model is related to the process that generates the data, 
similar to the dataset we are given. 

A model is said to learn from data 
if its performance on a given task improves 
after the data is taken into account. 

The goal is to find good models 
that generalize well to yet unseen data, 
which we may care about in the future. 

Learning can be understood as a way 
to automatically find patterns and structure 
in data by optimizing the parameters of the model.
